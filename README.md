# Django Tailwind E-Commerce Project
---
This project was created by following the tutorial from Dennis Ivy channel on youtube.

To challenge myself, I try to not following the styling. Besides, I use Tailwind CSS as it's main styling framework, rather than Bootstrap

The goal of this project is implementing basic Core Django Features as an
E-Commerce website.
